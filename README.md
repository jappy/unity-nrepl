nREPL for Unity

This project is depends and is based on:

* https://github.com/clojure-unity/clojure-unity
* https://github.com/clojure-unity/clojure-clr

The nREPL code is a hacked up version of:

* https://github.com/clojure/clr.tools.nrepl

Requires: cider-0.6alpha (currently ships with [emacs-live](https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live))

Note: Does work with cider-0.6.0 but when asks you for a lisp expression when connecting. Cider 0.7.0beta also works but asks for 3 lisp expressions when connecting. I usually just enter the number 1 or something. Cider-0.6alpha works fine.
